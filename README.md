# Immersive 3D Virtual Economy Visualization Platform

## Overview

This project is a **high-end, immersive web experience** built to showcase my skills in modern frontend engineering, 3D graphics, data visualization, and AI integration.

The website explores the **Virtual Economy**—including digital goods, skin economies, and virtual platforms such as **Roblox** and **Fortnite**—through interactive 3D scenes and AI-assisted insights. Instead of traditional dashboards, it mimics the aesthetic of a **digital research lab**, using motion, depth, and storytelling to present data in an engaging way.

This is a **portfolio project**, created to demonstrate technical capability, design sensibility, and experimental UI/UX approaches.
